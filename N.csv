1,Is Yuma Suzuki destined to be the best Japanese striker to never play for the Samurai Blue?,"As Japan return to action in the third round of Asian qualifiers for the 2026 FIFA World Cup with a distinct hurdle to overcome -- the injury-enforced absence of first-choice striker Ayase Ueda -- there was once again a notable omission from the squad selected by coach Hajime Moriyasu.  The fact that there has been little fanfare over the continued absence of one of the deadliest strikers currently active in Japanese football suggests how much of a norm is has now become.  Perhaps it has even got to the point where his supporters are now resigned to the fact that he will never pull on the Samurai Blue jersey under the Moriyasu regime.With each passing international window where he continues to be ignored in spite of what he achieves at club level, Yuma Suzuki looks destined to be the best striker to never represent Japan.  He came close before, having been called out in November 2018 before having to withdraw through injury, and has not been sighted since.  In all fairness, the selection of the trio in line to fill Ueda's void in upcoming matches against Indonesia and China cannot be argued against.  All three are currently based in Europe. Kyogo Furuhashi, in particular, has been prolific for Celtic while Koki Ogawa has given an excellent account of himself in the Eredivisie with NEC Nijmegen, in addition to averaging a goal in each of his seven caps so far.  Even the uncapped Yuki Ohashi has made a fine start to life in England since his summer move to Championship outfit Blackburn.  Still, the fact remains that -- in having to replace a spearhead who is equal parts target man as he is a poacher, and who has no qualms leading the line on his own and doing his fair share of dirty work -- Suzuki is arguably the closest thing to a like-for-like stand-in for Ueda.  And his credentials speak for themselves.   Yuma Suzuki enjoyed a successful spell with Sint-Truiden, which included a 17-goal campaign in the 2020-21 season of the Belgian Pro League. Jeroen Meuwsen/BSR Agency/Getty Images Having burst onto the scene with Kashima Antlers, Suzuki was a J1 League champion by the time he was 20 and went on to be named the AFC Champions League's Most Valuable Player when his team were last crowned champions of Asia in 2018 -- five months shy of his 23rd birthday.  Europe eventually came calling and he took no time at all to settle at Sint-Truiden, even recording a 17-goal campaign in 2020-21 which ranked the joint-fourth highest in the Belgian Pro League.  While a bigger move beckoned, Suzuki's career then took an expected detour when he found himself back at Kashima but the goals have continued to flow.  In the three years since he returned to Japan, Suzuki is among the highest scorers in the J1 League and is a barometer for his team's prospects of success.  Earlier this year, when he had an impressive run of nine goals in 11 outings, the Antlers looked a legitimate chance for a first J1 League title since 2016.  Since then, he has netted just thrice in 18 games. Unsurprisingly, Kashima's title challenge has crumbled.  At the weekend, the other side of Suzuki's game -- which many believe is the sole reason why he will not be considered for selection by Moriyasu -- reared its ugly head.  In a league game against Nagoya Grampus, Suzuki was on the receiving end of a heavy challenge by Keiya Shiihashi. Even before the referee had blown for the foul, the Antlers man had already sprung back onto his feet to aggressively barge over his opponent in retaliation.  He did not raise any hands and it was, in fact, a body charge that had Shiihashi falling to the ground and holding his face but, upon VAR review, the act was deemed violent enough to warrant a straight red.   Yuma Suzuki is no stranger to getting under the skin of the opposition and almost seems to relish being the pantomime villain of Japanese football. Hiroki Watanabe/Getty Images It is an aspect of the game that a character like Suzuki thrives on.  He has a history of taunting opposition fans. Veteran Asian football writer Paul Williams once remarked that Suzuki has ""a mongrel about him"" and ""isn't afraid to engage in the dark arts"", while also recalling an incident where the player was publicly shamed after his play-acting got an opposition player sent off.  Suzuki almost relishes being the pantomime villain, which isn't an easily-accepted role in a society that values respect and stoicism, where even just toeing the line could already be viewed as extreme behaviour.  Yet, with him, what you see is what you get. It is this same brashness that makes him a real nightmare for opposition defenders, from the way he physically batters his opponents to how he pulls off some quite remarkable goals.  What is perceived as arrogance by some can simply be confidence to others. Coaches that have been able the 'bad' in Suzuki's game have been the ones to benefit the most from his positive attributes.  There is no right or wrong answer in his continued absence from the international stage, especially if Japan continue to get results under Moriyasu. It is entirely the prerogative of the Samurai Blue coach to decide which players are the best fits for his squad, even if it is down to a matter of personality.  But there can be no denying that Suzuki is one of the standout players of his generation that Japan have produced. At the age of 28, he should be close to the peak of his powers.  Until, if ever, he wins his first cap, he will remain a genuine contender to the unwanted tag of being the best Japanese striker to never play for the Samurai Blue."
2,Who do Japan turn to in order to fill massive Ayase Ueda void?,"In their quest to reach an 8th consecutive FIFA World Cup, things have thus far gone swimmingly for Japan in the third round of the Asian qualifiers.  Their last outing may have seen their perfect streak come to an end as they played out a 1-1 draw with Australia, but they remain a healthy five points clear at the top of Group C after emphatically winning their opening three matches.  Yet, as they continue their bid to book their 2026 World Cup ticket over the next seven days -- starting with Friday's trip to Indonesia -- a significant hurdle has emerged for arguably the first time in their campaign.Last week, it was confirmed that striker Ayase Ueda will be sidelined for the rest of the year after sustaining a hamstring injury while featuring for Feyenoord in an Eredivisie clash with Ajax.  It means that the Samurai Blue will be without the services of a player who has been their first-choice striker since the conclusion of the last World Cup for both the game against Indonesia, as well as another away game against China next Tuesday.  Ueda's record speaks for itself. He has a creditable record of 14 goals from 30 caps -- with all 14 coming in just 18 matches since the start of 2023. His eight strikes so far in the ongoing Asian qualifiers is equal to South Korea and Tottenham star Son Heung-Min and only bettered by Qatar's Almoez Ali.  Still, it isn't just his scoring prowess that Japan will miss.  In addition to constantly being able to find the back of the net, Ueda's ability to lead the line as the Samurai Blue's focal point up front is pivotal to the team playing their best football.  With Japan coach Hajime Moriyasu regularly preferring to operate with a sole striker -- regardless of formation -- Ueda regularly has to cope with being double-teamed, or even triple-teamed, by opposition defences.  It is a task he not only dutifully performs but, in fact, excels in - with his strong hold-up play then paving the way for him to bring his teammates into play.Since Moriyasu adopted the current adventurous 3-2-4-1 formation that has seen Japan play some scintillating football in recent months, Ueda's role has enabled the likes of Takumi Minamino, Takefusa Kubo and Kaoru Mitoma to deal significant damage to the opposition from deeper and wider positions.  So, with Ueda unavailable for their next two games, who can Japan rely on to fill his big boots?  On paper, there are very decent options starting with the most-experienced duo -- Celtic pair Kyogo Furuhashi and Daizen Maeda.  Despite his prolific form since moving to the Scottish Premiership, where he has averaged over a goal every other game for three and a half seasons now, Furuhashi just has not quite tickled Moriyasu's fancy.  He missed out on the 2022 World Cup and the AFC Asian Cup at the start of the year, with Moriyasu requiring to directly address queries given how notable his omission was on both occasions.  Now back in the international fold, Moriyasu might use the absence of Ueda as an opportunity to give Furuhashi a chance to prove his worth.  Nonetheless, neither Furuhashi or Maeda, who is more likely to be called upon on the wing, have the physicality of Ueda even if both will offer the same defensive work rate as the first line of pressing.  In terms of a similar target-man type, Koki Ogawa -- also based in the Eredivisie with NEC Nijmegen -- would be a better bet and he has an impressive record of seven goals in as many caps.  Still, he is a relative newcomer at international level and it remains to be seen if Moriyasu will be bold enough to thrust him into the spotlight.   After just half a season with Sanfrecce Hiroshima, Yuki Ohashi's prolific form saw him earn a move to the Championship with Blackburn. Andrew Kearns - CameraSport via Getty Images Then, there is the fourth option. And, while he is the most unproven of the quartet, Yuki Ohashi's form may be impossible to ignore.  After previously spending the entirety of his career with the less-illustrious Shonan Bellmare, Ohashi's move to Sanfrecce Hiroshima at the start of this year saw him net 16 goals in 27 appearances as he ignited their title bid in the J1 League.  Within six months, Europe came calling and -- while he has gone goalless in his past ten outings -- he has already shown he has what it takes to succeed at Championship outfit Blackburn after netting five times in his first seven matches for the club.  From his off-the-ball movement that opens spaces for others and ability to play stronger than his frame suggests, as well as his keen eye for goal, Ohashi could just be the closest thing Moriyasu has to Ueda for this international window.  Japan will certainly miss their regular No. 9. But they have no shortage of viable options as they look to move closer to World Cup qualification, depending on what sort of spearhead Moriyasu plumps for."
3,Kyoga Nakamura hungry for more after winning first cap for Singapore,"SINGAPORE -- Just three weeks after gaining citizenship, Kyoga Nakamura officially represented Singapore for the first time on Thursday.  The BG Tampines Rovers playmaker played the full 90 minutes in the Lions' 3-2 friendly win over Myanmar, a game in which the hosts were headed for a shock loss after relinquishing an early lead before two goals in the final six minutes secured a much-needed win -- a first since Tsutomu Ogura took charge back in February.  It was undeniably a happy occasion for Nakamura, who has been based in Singapore since 2019 and had previously expressed his desire to represent his now-adopted nation -- having previously featured for Japan at the 2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup.Nonetheless, for the 28-year-old, who has often been praised for his professionalism and consistency, the performance left him with mixed feelings even after a man of the match display on his first senior cap.  ""I'm really happy to get this first game (for Singapore),"" he said in the postgame news conference. ""But we cannot be satisfied with this performance.  ""Especially those first ten minutes of the second half (when Singapore conceded twice in quick succession).""  ""We couldn't believe (how) we conceded those goals.""  The Lions certainly looked in a comfortable position despite their slender lead, with Myanmar having posed little threat in the opening 45.  But with the visitors coming out of the break showing renewed vigour, Singapore failed to respond adequately and were sluggish in responding as the opposition starting making meaningful forays forward for the first time in the contest -- leading to goals by Ye Yint Aung and Thiha Zaw.  Being able to eventually wrest the lead back and claim the win would still have been a relief to Ogura, who would have been quietly desperate to get off the mark even if his reign has already produced some positives even without victory.  The addition of Nakamura will come as a huge boost ahead of the ASEAN Championship, which kicks off on Dec. 8, especially with the Lions likely to be without several key players given the tournament does not fall within a recognised FIFA international window -- meaning clubs are not obliged to release players for national team duty.   Kyoga Nakamura was well received by the Singapore faithful after making his senior international debut for the Lions, and will be expected to play a pivotal role for his new adopted homeland at the upcoming ASEAN Championship. Football Association of Singapore The majority of Singapore's foreign-based contingent ply their trade in the Thai League 1 and Malaysia Super League, whose clubs have fixtures scheduled during the course of the ASEAN Championship.  The Singapore Premier League, however, will be on hiatus -- meaning Nakamura will be able to play a significant role as the Lions look to make it out of the group stage for only the second time since they were last crowned champions of Southeast Asia in 2012.  On Thursday, Nakamura was deployed as the most advanced of Singapore's central midfield trio, although he was still required to perform his fair share of defensive duties when the opposition were in possession.  He could even have netted a debut goal but just missed out on a cross what was ultimately converted by Farhan Zulkifli for the hosts' opener in the fifth minute.  Echoing his new national team coach's sentiments, Nakamura identified several aspects which Singapore still needed to improve in ahead of the ASEAN Championship.  ""As coach Ogura said, there will always be good and bad moments within the 90 minutes,"" he added.  ""In the good moments, we had a lot of chances but didn't finish by scoring the goals. We should have scored maybe two or three more in the first half.  ""Then, in the bad moments, we need to have more composure but also hunger and desire.  ""We're playing for the national team - for the country. We have to play with more hunger and desire.  ""We have to learn from this game.""  Nakamura will get another chance to line up for Singapore on Monday when they host Chinese Taipei, which looms as their final warmup before their ASEAN Championship campaign begins next month with a Group A opener against Cambodia on Dec. 11."
4,That Singapore were not happy with first win under Tsutomu Ogura is the biggest positive,"SINGAPORE -- At the fifth time of asking since Tsutomu Ogura took over at the helm back in February -- and for the first time in over a year -- Singapore are back to winning ways.  On Thursday, the Lions continued their preparations for the upcoming ASEAN Championship -- which kicks off on Dec. 8 -- with a 3-2 friendly win over Myanmar.  The scoreline on its own already would not have been the biggest confidence booster. The manner in which the game unfolded? Even more so.  After largely dominating proceedings in the opening 45, where they edged ahead as early as the fifth minute courtesy of Farhan Zulkifli's opener, Singapore then failed to turn up for the start of the second half.  All of a sudden, Myanmar found themselves ahead by the 52nd minute -- having turned the tie completely on its head via goals from Ye Yint Aung and Thiha Zaw.  Even then, it took some time for Singapore to muster some sort of response although a late rally -- with substitutes Shawal Anuar and Naqiuddin Eunos scoring in the final six minutes -- eventually saw them claim the win.  Although the thrill of the dramatic late win understandably resulted in an almighty roar emanating from the National Stadium at the final whistle, there was a slight possibility that it might paper over the cracks of what was ultimately far from an excellent display.  And previous regimes have been overly defensive against any negativity directed at the team, regardless of whether it was fair or warranted criticism.  In that sense, Ogura has been a breath of fresh air.  Earlier in the year, after he had masterminded a 2-2 draw against traditional heavyweights China in the Asian qualifiers for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Ogura received applause for the perceived excellent result as he entered the conference room for his postmatch media duties.  He immediately questioned the reception, suggesting it only would have been warranted had he pulled off a win.  His candid approach -- in a world of PR-savvy, even trained, coaches -- continued after the win over Myanmar.  If it is also rubbing off on the team, it bodes well for the future of Singapore.  ""I told the players I'm satisfied with the performance but what I saw in the locker room were not faces of players who had just won a game,"" said Ogura.  ""They all know what the expectations are.  ""We weren't bad in the beginning of the game but, after we scored to make it 1-0, we stopped playing our football. In the second half, I do not want to remember those first ten minutes.  ""To conceded one goal isn't good but still okay, but we conceded two. If we continue letting in goals like this, it will always make the game difficult.  ""It's not just one thing - we must improve more. When we're in a good moment, we need to keep the ball for longer. When the opponent is having a good moment, we must stay patient and have composure.  ""Today we played our (brand of) football for a short (period of) time. We need to do this for longer for the (ASEAN Championship).""  Ogura was then asked if he had figured out by now what his strongest XI is. He pointed out how it wasn't fair for him to answer the question with debuting man of the match Kyoga Nakamura seated next to him.  In a lighthearted moment, Nakamura volunteered to block his ears in order for his coach to give an answer.  Ogura was also questioned what his plans were for the next game against Chinese Taipei on Monday. In mock exasperation, he stressed how tired he was from the match that had just concluded and that he would only start looking ahead once he got back to his hotel room later in the evening.  There is a different air that currently surrounds the Lions.  The 58-year-old still has to plenty to prove with Singapore's displays on the field. In all fairness, he has not even a year into his reign.  Off the field, however, his candor has helped maintain a consistent narrative that they are standards that have to be met. And when they aren't, he will be honest enough to admit it.  Despite ultimately getting a breakthrough victory, the Lions probably did not meet the standards that Ogura has set for them against Myanmar.  It is a massive positive that they felt exactly the same way."
5,Son Heung-min's milestone goal the icing on the cake on a night of positives for South Korea,"Son Heung-Min already has a legitimate claim to being South Korea's greatest footballer of all time.  In what has been a glittering career thus far, he reached another significant milestone on the international stage on Thursday.  As he converted a 19th-minute penalty in what eventuated in a 3-1 win over Kuwait in the Asian qualifiers for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Son notched his 50th goal for South Korea.The Tottenham star is now just nine goals away from surpassing the legendary Cha Bum-Kun's record haul of 58 that has stood for almost four decades now. He is also just six games away from matching South Korea's appearance record -- jointly held by Cha and current national team coach Hong Myung-Bo.  There are those who, with some validity, believe that team success should still be the barometer when ultimately appraising Son's legacy and where he stands among icons from a previous generation.  Hong will always go down as the captain of the team which famously finished fourth at the 2002 World Cup, although it is worth remembering that Cha's accomplishments on the international stage were an Asian Games gold medal and a runners-up finish at the AFC Asian Cup -- both of which Son has achieved.  Even if Park Ji-Sung is thrown into the mix, he too never won an Asian Cup although he was part of the 2002 World Cup side, and also has a long list of team silverware with Manchester United and PSV Eindhoven.  It is unconceivable that Son will not eventually become South Korea's record goal-scorer and appearance-maker. He may even achieve it within the next 12 months.  For now, the cause for the plaudits to continue falling Son's way will come form him reaching a half-century of international goals on Thursday and, yet, it was far from the only thing for the Taegeuk Warriors to smile about.  There has been plenty of talk surrounding the South Korea captain's strenuous workload of late. He missed the previous international window due to an injury sustained while on club duty.  Just last week, Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou stressed that Son was still working his way back to full fitness and shared his hope that he might not be overly exerted while on his current South Korea duty.  It would have come as huge relief to Postecoglou that Son was only required to play 65 minutes on Thursday, with South Korea's control of proceedings allowing them to give their skipper an early rest ahead of next week's meeting with Palestine -- who happen to be the only side to have denied them victory so far in the third round of Asian qualifiers.   With closest challengers Iraq and Jordan playing out a 0-0 draw, South Korea are now five points clear at the top of Group B in the third round of Asian qualifiers for the 2026 FIFA World Cup after beating Kuwait 3-1 on Thursday. Asian Football Confederation And while Son reaching a half-century of international goals undeniably grabbed the headlines, it far from the only thing for the Taegeuk Warriors to smile about.  Fittingly, the man that came on for him -- and sealed the victory with a third goal -- also looks one with an excellent chance of reaching a similarly lofty level in the future.  Bae Jun-Ho is still only 21 but he is already catching the eye in England with Championship outfit Stoke, who were convinced to sign him when he had just 25 professional appearances under his belt.  Like Son, Bae can do a job in any of the attacking positions although he does his best work down the left.  He is one for the future but is showing he can also contribute in the here and now, having scored twice from just five senior caps even if he has to bide his time behind the likes of Son, Lee Kang-In, Hwang Hee-Chan and Lee Jae-Sung.  While there is already plenty of hype over an even younger prospect in 18-year-old Yang Min-Hyeok, who will join Son at Tottenham in January, there is still plenty of development in his game to come -- with Bae significantly further down the road to being the finished article.  Even if Son continued to be the star attraction on Thursday, there was another accomplished display from Hwang In-Beom.  The midfield metronome is arguably as influential a player as Son and provided glorious assists for both Oh Se-Hun and Bae -- the first, with an inch-perfect ball over the top, and the second, with a incisive slide-rule pass that few others could have envisioned.  Hwang In-Beom already boasts extensive experience in previous spells with Rubin Kazan, Olympiacos and Red Star Belgrade but he might just have reached new heights since moving to the Eredivisie with Feyenoord in the summer.   Equally influential in South Korea's win over Kuwait on Thursday was playmaker Hwang In-Beom, who produced two glorious assists that led to goals for Oh Se-Hun and Bae Jun-Ho. Asian Football Confederation And it wasn't just all about the established campaigners.  Thursday also saw international debuts for Lee Hyun-Ju and Lee Tae-Seok.  The former was signed by Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich even before he made his professional debut and is currently honing his craft in the German second tier with Hannover, while the latter will be no stranger to Hong given his father -- Lee Eul-Yong -- was a longtime teammate of Hong who played 51 times for South Korea.  All in all, there were plenty of positives for Hong to take out of Thursday evening -- which would have been even more heartening given things haven't exactly gone his way since he took over the job back in July.  His appointment was greeted with skepticism and it did not help that his second stint at the helm of the Taegeuk Warriors was that goalless stalemate with Palestine, which saw him on the receiving end of boos from his own supporters.  Despite the negativity that lingers around him, Hong has done alright.  South Korea are unbeaten in the third round of Asian qualifiers and now hold a healthy five-point lead in Group B at the halfway point.  He still relies on his Europe-based stars but has been able to hand opportunities to younger and domestically-based players simply because he is familiar with them, which was a big criticism of his predecessor Jürgen Klinsmann -- who now infamously decided against relocating to South Korea and was hence hardly present at K League matches.  Hong still has more work to do to get the South Korea faithful fully onside, a scenario that is nearly impossible for someone like Son to fathom -- especially after racking up his 50th goal for his country.  But on an night when Son once again grabbed the headlines, he was just one of several positives for South Korea."
6,World Cup qualifying: Socceroos wanted more than draw but better placed than three months ago,"MELBOURNE, Australia -- If there were ever a game in which both teams could feel aggrieved to have missed out on all three points, and what a win could have meant for their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification hopes, yet simultaneously be grateful for the point they did claim, it would be the 0-0 stalemate between Australia and Saudi Arabia on Thursday.  As the dust settled at AAMI Park, it felt almost incredulous that the game finished scoreless. On multiple occasions, the Socceroos were presented with gilt-edged chances to score, only for their final touch to prove wayward or tepid. The visitors saw an early period of control peter out without a single shot -- at full-time they would be credited with only three official attempts on goal despite nearly 60% of possession, compared with Australia's 13 -- and while they thought they'd stolen victory with a 94th-minute dagger, Sultan Al-Ghannam's would-be-winner was disallowed due to obstruction by an offside (by centimetres) Ali Al-Bulayhi. This, in turn, gave the hosts a reprieve they almost turned into a ridiculous late winner via Riley McGree's bicycle kick. Twists aplenty but, ultimately, no goals.In the broader context of AFC qualifying, the result sees the teams largely as they were. With five games played and five to come, they both sit on six points in Group C -- Australia second ahead of Saudi Arabia on goal difference -- and remain the most likely sides to join Japan in automatically punching a tickets to the 2026 FIFA World Cup with a top-two finish. They were even done an unlikely favour by China in a later fixture, with Zhang Yuning's dramatic 90th-minute winner seeing Branko Ivanković's side defeat Bahrain to prevent the Gulf team from leapfrogging them into second. It's not the worst position for either to be in, with plenty of football yet to be played; and even if second place proves beyond one of them -- or both -- the expansion of the World Cup to 48 teams means another phase of qualification awaits teams that finish third and fourth in the groups.  Simultaneously, however, the circumstances that have delivered them to this point are not how either side would have envisioned things. With every other opponent in the group now played once, Australia and Saudi each have a single win -- against China -- three draws and a loss. Both are scoring at a rate of less than one goal a game, with the Socceroos the only nation from Asia to go scoreless in three fixtures during this phase of qualification. While Bahrain may have fallen a point behind after their loss to China, the latter have drawn level on six points, despite playing quite badly at times, and bottom-placed Indonesia, Saudi's next opponent, are just three points back with a game in hand (albeit, that contest is a likely loss to Japan). This means there's very little safety net between the disastrous possibility of failing to qualify from this phase and not even advancing to a further phase. Just like Thursday's game, it's almost contradictory. Both Australia and Saudi Arabia are well placed but, simultaneously, qualification sits on a knife edge.   Tony Popovic has steadied the Socceroos, won the game he had to win, and taken points off the two other strongest teams in Group C. Photo by Koji Watanabe/Getty Images The fact of the matter is that if either side had simply done what was expected in their opening fixtures, things would be much simpler. Should results elsewhere have been the same but Australia hadn't fallen to a calamitous defeat by Bahrain on the Gold Coast -- just their second home loss in a 'live' World Cup qualifier since 1981 -- and converted one of their numerous chances to defeat Indinesia subsequently, they'd be in a commanding position even with yesterday's draw. The same goes for the Saudis, whose winless run in home qualifiers stands at four after draws with Bahrain and Indonesia as well as a first defeat to Japan after a 2-1 loss to Jordan in the final fixture of the previous stage of qualification. The squandered opportunities on Thursday, therefore, exist both within the context of the game and the broader scope of qualification.  This probably explains why both coaches on Thursday were different to those who commenced this phase of qualification: Tony Popovic in his third game in charge of Australia, after taking over from Graham Arnold, and Hervé Renard in his first after returning to Saudi to replace Roberto Mancini. For the Australian, the result continued an unbeaten start at the helm of the side he played for 58 times, joining a 3-1 win over China and a 0-0 draw away to Japan during the last window. Given the circumstances of his arrival -- his appointment coming just 20 days before the clash with China in Adelaide -- it's a beginning that would have looked better with a win over the Saudis but, again, could have been a lot worse.  The Socceroos were somewhat reeling after their loss to Bahrain and draw with Indonesia that sparked Arnold's surprise resignation, but Popovic has steadied the ship, won the game he had to win, and taken points off the two other strongest teams in the group. That's a positive. The players have also responded; a change in culture from Arnold's more relaxed, 'Socceroo Family' atmosphere to the more austere, 'elite' expectations of Popovic has seemingly proven invigorating. On a footballing level, the move from one coach to the other wasn't philosophically revolutionary but the change to a 3-4-2-1 in possession, while still clearly a work in progress, appears to have a higher ceiling and level of adaptability than the grinding approach of Arnold.   Jackson Irvine leads the Socceroos off after their 0-0 draw against Saudi Arabia. Photo by Graham Denholm/Getty Images As the likes of Joe Gauci and Jackson Irvine remarked post-game, the Socceroos are in a better place compared to were they a few months ago. And with fixtures against Indonesia and China -- the two lowest-ranked sides in the group -- to come after facing Bahrain away next week, they're entering a three-game stretch in which nine points isn't an unfair expectation. Craig Goodwin will be back from suspension for the Bahrain game, but an ankle injury to Nishan Velupillay, who provided a spark upon his second-half introduction, is a potential blow. And for all the foundations being laid, we're still yet to see this side put together a full 90 minutes under Popovic, with the first half against the Saudis, despite producing more chances to score, acknowledged by the coach as one in which they struggled in possession. As a result, the chances spurned mostly came from high transitions and set pieces, a familiar bugbear.  Ultimately, on Thursday, missed chances haunted a Socceroos outfit that probably should have won. An ""OK result"", and an ""opportunity maybe missed,"" as Popovic described it. But lest that become the legacy of this qualification campaign, the Socceroos need to take another step in the coming games, starting in Riffa next Tuesday."
7,"Transfer rumors, news: PSG, Barca want to sign Kvaratskhelia","Khvicha Kvaratskhelia is attracting interest from European giants in France and Spain, while Liverpool weigh-up a move for USMNT forward Ricardo Pepi. Join us for the latest transfer news, rumors, and gossip from around the globe.TRENDING RUMORS - PSG and Barcelona remain interested in Khvicha Kvaratskhelia as contract negotiations with Napoli continue, per Gazzetta dello Sport. The Georgia superstar is under contract at Napoli until 2027, but his current deal sees him earn just €1.5 million ($1.6m) per season. Negotiations are set to continue this week, with Kvaratskhelia currently requesting a salary increase to just under €8m per season. PSG are reportedly willing to test Napoli's resolve once more, after having a €100m bid for the 23-year-old rejected last summer.  - Liverpool are evaluating PSV's Ricardo Pepi as a potential transfer target, Ekrem Konur reports. The USA international has impressed in the Eredivisie this season, scoring six goals in 11 league games. Atletico Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, and Borussia Dortmund are also said to be closely monitoring his development. PSV have set the 21-year-old's transfer fee at €25m.- Chelsea could rival Real Madrid and Manchester United for Norwegian wonderkind Sverre Nypan, TEAMtalk reports. The 17-year-old, who can play in midfield and attack, has already featured over 50 times for Rosenborg since making his debut earlier this year. Borussia Dortmund are also said to be monitoring Nypan, who is under contract at the Norwegian giants until December 2026. Rosenborg will seek a transfer fee of €25m for the youngster.  - Real Madrid want to sign Liverpool right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold, Bayer Leverkusen centre-back Jonathan Tah and Bayern Munich left-back Alphonso Davies on free transfers in the summer, says AS. The Spanish giants are keen to save money and they will have got themselves a huge bargain if they can land the trio for nothing. ESPN sources have also revealed that they are keen on signing Bayer Leverkusen attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz, but his transfer could cost around €100m.  - Manchester United and Liverpool are keen on signing Fulham left-back Antonee Robinson, according to Football Insider.

8,"AFCON kits: Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Senegal jerseys rated","The Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) is scheduled to begin just over a year from now, in December 2025, but that hasn't stopped Puma launching the first batch of brand-new home and away kits that five of the continent's top national teams will be wearing on the big stage.  The kits were first revealed as part of a live event staged at Rabat Airport, with hosts Morocco debuting their 2025 home and away designs alongside those of fellow contenders in Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Senegal.  The 2025 edition of AFCON is set to be hosted across six cities in Morocco, with 24 teams vying for continental glory and Ivory Coast attempting to defend their crown from the 2023 tournament.Each kit is designed to reflect the culture, history and identity of the country it represents and, as an added flourish, Morocco and Ghana have even seen elements of their kits designed by artists Abderrahmane Trabsini and Jefferson Osei, who have woven traditional patterns, colours and symbolism into their respective creations.  Here's is a look at all 10 of Puma's AFCON kit designs -- which stars like Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mané, Achraf Hakimi, Mohammed Kudus and Amad Diallo are set to compete in -- with each one given a rating out of 10.  Egypt  Puma Home: While not a huge departure from the what we have come to expect, Egypt have been furnished with a smart and refined home shirt in deep red that features subtle texturing in the form of an all-over zig-zag pattern inspired by pharaohs, pyramids and sand dunes. Those motifs are easy to miss at first glance, but they provide a welcome sprinkling of extra charm.  Rating: 7/10   Puma Away: The design of the away shirt is basically a straight colour flip of the home design, with white and black replacing red and black in this case. This time the textured pattern has the pharaohs front and centre on the chest between the badges and above a pile of pyramids.  Rating: 5/10  Ghana  Puma Home: As created by Ghanaian designer Jefferson Osei in collaboration with fellow countryman and painter Daniel Alum Jasper, the Black Stars' will be instantly recognisable in their 2025 home kit. Jasper painted the ""Adinkra"" symbols that are woven into the fabric which represent the traditional decorative motifs found on clothing, art, woodwork and architecture to celebrate cherished items and aspects of everyday life. At first glance the shirt appears to be plain white but, In an ingenious touch, the symbols start to reveal themselves as the players perspire and the fabric becomes increasingly saturated. The sweatier the better!  Rating: 7/10   Puma Away: The bright yellow away kit pays homage to Ghana's Gold Coast, which lies along the country's southern shore on the Gulf of Guinea. The ubiquitous black star forms the center of a radiating pattern that represents the unity and collective pride embodied by the national football team. Elsewhere, the ""Adinkra"" symbols appear on the sleeves and the star theme continues with the tricolour taping applied along the collar and sleeve cuffs for a smart finishing touch.  Rating: 8/10  Ivory Coast  Puma Home: The reigning AFCON champions will seek to defend their title while wearing a blazing orange home shirt that is directly inspired by ""La Fête des Masques"" (""The Festival of the Masks""), an event held every November to celebrate the spirits of the forest. The festival is famous for the carved masks and elaborate costumes worn during the celebrations which are usually decorated with masses of fringes made from straw, leaves, reeds and fibres. According to the manufacturers, those fringes have been depicted in the fabric of the shirt but there is barely any similarity between the source material and the end result.  Rating: 6/10   Puma Away: The Ivorians' white away kit is also inspired by ""La Fête des Masquess"" but this time the faint pattern found dotted across the torso is a visual reference to the movement and ceremonial dances performed during the event and the marks left in the earth thereafter. All in all, it's rather splendid Having one of the best international federation crests in world football doesn't do any harm, either.  Rating: 7/10  Morocco  Puma Home: Designed by Abderrahmane Trabsini, Morocco's home kit is festooned with intricate patterns that are taken from the traditional ""Zellige"" clay tiles that have been used to decorate houses and buildings across North Africa for centuries. The fabric bears a star similar to that found on the Moroccan national flag. That repeating pattern is then cleverly inverted on the flanks of the torso to create a very subtle striping effect that can only really be seen clearly in certain lights.  Rating: 7.5/10   Puma Away: Trabsini's design for the away kit is an homage to the craft and artisanship of the Berbers who form the largest indigenous tribe in Morocco. The shirt has Berber symbols of fertility, faith and protection stamped all over it, particularly beneath the arms where several have been applied to a green panel running down the side of the jersey. The taping of the collar and cuffs is decorated with a zig-zag Berber pattern that is often incorporated into Moroccan rug designs.  Rating: 7/10  Senegal  Puma Home: Senegal were defending AFCON champions in the 2023 tournament but ultimately saw their defence come to an abrupt end in the round of 16 when Ivory Coast knocked them out on penalties. The Lions of Teranga will be hoping that their new 2025 kit will inspire them to return to the final this time around, given that it is meant to be infused with ""Teranga"" itself -- i.e. the prized national value of hospitality, hard work and comradery. The pristine white shirt is livened with flashes of green, gold and red which form a stylish central stripe that breaks at the midriff to leave room for the squad number to be applied.  Rating: 6.5/10   Puma Away: The green away shirt is vaguely reminiscent of Chelsea's 2024-25 home strip in that it appears to be covered in a slick, oily, liquidised graphic. However, after your eyes take a moment to adjust reveals that the seemingly random swirls actually form the image of a giant lion's head that is fiercely roaring out from the centre of the shirt. No matter which way you slice it, that's undeniably awesome.  Rating: 8.5/10"
9,Five issues Rúben Amorim must address as Man United manager,"Rúben Amorim has arrived in England as the latest coach charged with bringing back Manchester United's glory days. He's the sixth permanent boss to take the top job at Old Trafford since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down in 2013, following on from David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag. The other five have overseen mixed results, but no one has yet been able to take United back to the top in the Premier League or the Champions League.  Still only 39, Amorim has forged a reputation as one of the best young coaches in Europe after winning two league titles in charge of Sporting CP. He has admitted his task at United will be difficult, but he insists he's ready for the challenge of flipping the fortunes of one of the biggest clubs in the world.  With his reign set to start with his first game, against Ipswich Town on Nov. 24, here are some of the big issues facing United's new head coach.  1. Pick his wing-backs Speaking after his final Sporting game on Sunday, Amorim gave his strongest hint yet that he intends to play his preferred 3-4-3 system from the off at United, saying: ""You have to start with a structure that you know."" There's no reason why he shouldn't because it's the way he has been successful at Sporting. The issue, however, is that he's inheriting a squad built for variations of 4-3-3 which means, for now, he'll have to use square pegs for round holes.United have six senior centre-backs -- plenty of depth for the three positions in the centre of defence -- but finding wing-backs might be slightly more complicated, opening the door for some players to undergo a positional makeover. Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui and Luke Shaw are the most obvious candidates for the wide roles, but what about Alejandro Garnacho and Amad Diallo?  Amorim plays with two inside forwards (a pair of creative No. 10s) rather than high-and-wide wingers, which could see Garnacho and Amad accommodated as hybrid full-backs. It would mean taking on more defensive responsibility than they're used to, something that could be learned under the right coach.  2. Find a place for Marcus Rashford Amorim's preference for three centre-backs rather than two means that, because of simple maths as much as anything else, United will set up with one fewer attacking player in the team. There will be a central striker (likely Rasmus Højlund or Joshua Zirkzee) with two No. 10s behind him. One of those positions will go to Bruno Fernandes, but the other is up for grabs. It's the most likely role for Marcus Rashford, but it will require compromise from a player who has made no secret of his preference to play on the left side of a front three.  Rashford can certainly do the job from an attacking point of view. Toward the end of his reign, Ten Hag used Rashford as an inside forward on the right with Garnacho pushed out on the left wing. It was from there that Rashford hit a glorious pass to Garnacho to score against Brentford. The question, though, is whether Rashford can be relied upon to do the defensive side of the job.  Amorim's two No. 10s -- Francisco Trincão and Pedro Gonçalves, who were superb against Manchester City -- are expected to press and retreat behind the ball quickly when possession turns over. One of the criticisms of Rashford from United fans is that he doesn't always work hard enough out of possession, whether it's tracking back or putting pressure on the ball. That won't be tolerated by Amorim.   Amorim, right, has arrived in Manchester to begin as United's new manager. He has a long list of issues to address. Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images 3. Develop Rasmus Højlund Scoring goals was a big problem for Ten Hag throughout his time in charge and in the end, it contributed to his downfall. In his two full seasons, United scored 115 Premier League goals; to put that into context, Manchester City scored 190 over the same time period. Newcastle United scored 153. Sporting scored 96 goals on their way to the Portuguese title last season and Amorim needs someone to put the ball in the net for him at United.  Zirkzee has looked way off the pace since his summer move from Bologna, scoring once in 16 appearances. Højlund looks a better fit for Amorim's system, but he needs to develop into a prolific goal-scorer. He's got 18 goals in 55 games since arriving from Atalanta in 2023 and even though it's a lot to ask for a player who is still only 21, those numbers need to improve quickly.  Amorim got the best out of Viktor Gyökeres at Sporting -- he's got 66 goals in 68 games since arriving from Coventry in 2023 -- and turned the Sweden international into one of the most sought-after strikers in Europe. If he can do the same with Højlund, it will pave the way for success at United.  4. Make Old Trafford a fortress again Amorim is picking up United from a low ebb. Sitting 13th in the table, expectations for the rest of this season are modest and he can use that to his advantage. No one is expecting the new boss to immediately start sweeping aside Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal. Making it hard for opposing teams to get results at Old Trafford is something small, but it would be a step in the right direction.  play 0:57 Amorim: I know how I will set-up Man UnitedRuben Amorim says he is ready for the challenge at Man United after his final game in charge of Sporting. Overall, Amorim needs to change the momentum. United lost six of their 19 league games at home last season, and have already suffered heavy home defeats to Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur during this campaign.  A new coach coming in and trying to implement a new style midseason is always going to have teething problems. But if Amorim can start churning out results at Old Trafford, it will immediately put him on the right track. Home games against Bodo/Glimt, Everton, Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth and Newcastle before the turn of the year are all winnable.  5. Play with a pattern One of the key criticisms against Ten Hag during his 2½-year tenure was that fans struggled to see what his plan was for this team. He struggled to implement the quick, high-intensity football that made him so successful at Ajax, which left his United team without a clear identity. There's a general acceptance among United supporters that Amorim faces an uphill task in the early months of his reign, but if he can display his tactical principles -- aggressive pressing and a high defensive line -- on a regular basis, it will earn him a lot of credit even if results don't immediately follow.  It's likely that Amorim will have to adapt his style to the Premier League and to the players he has available, but a clear way of playing will help win over the fans quickly."
10,How Bompastor made perfect start to Chelsea's post-Hayes era,"LONDON -- After the exit of legendary manager Emma Hayes to the USWNT this summer, Chelsea couldn't have dreamed of a better opening to the 2024-25 season under her replacement Sonia Bompastor. With a flawless record across all competitions -- three Champions League wins and six commanding Women's Super League (WSL) victories -- Bompastor has led the Blues to their best-ever start to a WSL season.  When Bompastor left Lyon -- where she spent 17 years in total as a player, academy manager, and first-team coach -- to move to London, some wondered how she and the Chelsea players would handle the transition after Hayes' glittering 12-year spell. But Bompastor has silenced any doubts, seamlessly putting the club on track for what would be their sixth-consecutive WSL title, and ending any suggestions that she would need time to adapt.  A source told ESPN that there was initial uncertainty about how smoothly the team would adapt to new management. However, the squad have quickly embraced Bompastor's leadership, adjusting to her style with remarkable ease.The new manager's impact was immediate and decisive. Bompastor led Chelsea to a crucial 2-1 win over Arsenal -- the club's first victory at the Emirates Stadium -- and set a league record with four consecutive away wins. Her Champions League experience, including titles as both player (2011, 2012) and coach (2022), has been instrumental, with Chelsea picking up a pivotal group-stage win over Real Madrid, and their early-season form has resulted in them being installed as one of the favourites.  ""It's a huge target on our backs,"" Chelsea goalkeeper Zecira Musovic told ESPN. ""Everyone wants to beat us, and that's, of course, something that we know because we've won the league so many times now.  ""Of course, someone else wants to win it but I think that's something that is just a friendly reminder that we have to keep the hard work up, that we have to really be disciplined, and that we can't relax in any moment. Because the moment we relax, someone else would definitely grab that from us.""  Despite the perfect start, Bompastor and her players know the job is far from finished. Chelsea face two critical tests in the weeks ahead as they prepare to host Manchester City in Saturday's high-stakes WSL clash (stream live on ESPN+ at 12.30 p.m. ET), before the rescheduled showdown with in-form Manchester United.  But how has Bompastor managed to hit the ground running, and will this momentum carry the Blues through their upcoming battles?  High demands in training  Sonia Bompastor has had a wonderful start to the season in her new job. Marc Atkins/Getty Images Bompastor's drive for excellence is as fierce as it is relentless, setting high standards and demanding intensity from every player -- a reflection of her deep-seated hunger to win.  ""As a manager, I am really competitive, and maybe I don't like losing,"" the French coach told ESPN when she joined in the summer. ""This is something I need to work on. I am so competitive, and I am a really bad loser. I am a manager who really likes to take care of people as well. It's a difficult job, actually.""  Thankfully for her, losing hasn't been a problem so far. Chelsea's blistering league form has yielded six consecutive wins and 23 goals, with 13 different players finding the net. This depth has put Chelsea eight goals ahead of first-placed Manchester City on goal difference -- the edge that clinched last season's title when points were tied.""She's very demanding,"" midfielder Erin Cuthbert told ESPN. ""That's something I really like from a manager. She knows what she wants, she doesn't settle, she doesn't like sloppiness in training, she doesn't let you sit back and chill for 10 minutes. There's no let up from her, and I really enjoy that she knows exactly what she wants.""  Cuthbert also revealed that Bompastor's ethos is based around rigorous preparation on the training pitch.  ""She demands a lot of technical execution from everyone, and I think she will never settle on what she wants to achieve, which, for sure, certainly demands training at a high intensity; if you can't do it in training, then you can't play it in the game,"" she said.  ""I think that's been part of the reason why we've had a good start to the season because training at such a high level, and we're starting games really fast. We're scoring the first 15 minutes of almost every game so far so at least what we're doing in training has been working with.""  Bompastor has already begun shaping Chelsea into her own vision, bringing in fresh talent like Sandy Baltimore and Lucy Bronze, and retooling the style of play that Hayes established over more than a decade. The shift is apparent on the pitch, where the side have a renewed intensity and dynamic approach.  ""I think the differences [between Bompastor and Hayes] are maybe slightly more focused on training and how she manages players; how she manages them on the pitch, what she demands,"" Cuthbert said. ""I think Emma demanded things, but she demanded different things. I think Sonia demands a lot of technical execution. There's a greater focus on building up from the back.""  Musovic believes both managers had an impact on her development but, while she credits Hayes for the foundational skills that inspired her own coaching ambitions, the goalkeeper is learning a lot under Bompastor already.  ""I really like to work with Sonia and the new management,"" she told ESPN. ""I think she's really ambitious. She's intense in a good way. She knows what she wants from us, from herself and that's a type of coach that I really like, someone who's demanding, and I'm a curious person so I was really excited to get to know them all and to get to know a different type of coach.  ""For sure, [she's] a really good coach, a good person, something that we value in Chelsea as well, you have to be a good person because that's when we can find each other and work together.""  ""Every game is important"" Chelsea may be the only team yet to drop points in the WSL, but they are not the only ones who are still unbeaten. Last season's runners-up, Manchester City, have only dropped two points in their 2-2 draw with Arsenal; while Marc Skinner's Manchester United are also yet to lose, though they have slipped to three consecutive draws to leave them in fifth place with 12 points.  Chelsea take on City this weekend and it will be their biggest test of the season thus far. But the players always ensure they face the big games with the same intensity as any other.  ""I think another strength of ours is that we prepare in a similar way regardless of which opponent we're facing,"" Musovic said. ""We have our identity; we have our game model that we want to fulfil in the best possible way. Yes, we're playing against Manchester City at Stamford Bridge, and hopefully a sold-out Bridge, so that's something that we are super excited about. But we have our style of play, how we want to come across to our fans and the standards that we are creating for each other.  ""So I don't think we'll be preparing in a different way. Of course, they have amazing players that we will watch out for. We have a respect for that challenge. But we definitely have a strong belief in our group and what we are capable of. So that's something that we will focus on.""  While it might reap benefits come the end of the season, there are no extra rewards for beating a title rival and this mindset keeps the squad grounded.  ""From a personal level, I prepare no different because every game in the league season is a maximum of three points, and that's the way you see it,"" Cuthbert said. ""No game is more important to the other; I guess the fans obviously see games that are slightly more important, and as a player, you still want to be playing in the biggest games, but if you can do it in the other games and there's no point you are doing it in the big games.  ""Every game is important to me. Of course, having the opportunity to play Manchester City at Stamford Bridge is a big moment and it's certainly a big game in the women's football calendar for the fans.""  Always room for improvement  Bompastor's mentality means she never accepts anything less than 100% Marco Steinbrenner/DeFodi Images via Getty Images One overriding theme that comes from everyone at Chelsea right now is that no matter how well things have gone, there is always more to do, room to improve, and no time to settle before focusing on the next game.  This is the mentality has made the side far more competitive. They are able to ride the high, enjoy the moment but not get too carried away. The focus is always on an area to improve ahead of the next game.""The standard is to win every game, so we just look at how we can improve,"" Musovic said. ""Yes, we won [six games], but we still have a lot of things to improve, and we have big goals for this season, so we just have to keep pushing  ""I think that's something that's really important in this environment. Yes, [when] we win a game you can be happy about it, you can celebrate a little bit. But then the next day is like: 'OK, next game, we have to focus. What can we do? What can we improve?'  It's finding that balance between being satisfied and happy for that game, but still be a little bit frustrated about what we can learn and what can we improve to have an even better performance next game? We are definitely celebrating our wins, but not too much because we're an ambitious bunch who want to do better each game.""  Even after the dominant 7-0 win over newly promoted Crystal Palace at the end of September, Bompastor saw room for improvement and her feedback was clear and direct.  ""You can always ask for more. There is always room for improvement, especially from the first half,"" she told a news conference after that game. ""I think we created some opportunities and good chances, but we only scored one. I think we should probably have scored two or three. When you are able to be clinical, it kills the game, and this is the mentality we want to have.""  Bompastor's outlook balances optimism with realism. She's not one to get carried away by big wins or past results to sustain momentum. For her, each victory is simply another building block toward the ultimate goal: winning titles.  ""Even if it has maybe been a perfect start for us in terms of results, points and also performances -- we haven't won anything yet,"" she said following the 3-0 win over Liverpool last weekend. ""We need to keep a good balance between confidence, which is really important for the players, but also we need to keep our head on our shoulders and be in line with reality. That's my job to make sure I maintain that balance.""  Chelsea managed to break their curse of dropping points against Liverpool away -- the first time they've won there since 2019 -- but that only adds to the feeling that something new is happening at the club. For Cuthbert, a ninth WSL title -- and sixth in a row -- would mean the world to her. But with City to come, she knows the journey ahead will be challenging.  ""We're exactly where we want to be right now,"" she said. ""I think to win it six times in a row would be unprecedented, to be honest with you, but I'm under no illusions that it's also the hardest thing to win."""

16,"In Ayase Ueda's absence, Kōki Ogawa issues legitimate claim as Japan's alternative spearhead","When it was confirmed that Ayase Ueda would be absent from the current international window -- after suffering an injury that will rule him out for the rest of 2024 while on club duty with Feyenoord -- there was initially slight apprehension as to how Japan would cope without the man who has made their sole striker berth his own in recent times.  With 14 goals in his last 18 international appearances since the start of 2023, Ueda's eye for goal is unquestionable.  More so than the sheer numbers, Ueda's style of play -- where he often manfully takes on multiple opponents to create space for the more-withdrawn attackers to come into the game -- has made him perfect for Japan coach Hajime Moriyasu's system, which sees equally-talented players like Takefusa Kubo, Takumi Minamino and Daichi Kamada from deeper.But, as Japan continued to march on the third round of Asian qualifiers for the 2026 FIFA World Cup by following up last week's rout of Indonesia with a comfortable 3-1 win over China on Tuesday, Ueda absence was hardly felt thanks to one man.  In what was a three-horse race to take over as the focal point in attack, it was Kōki Ogawa who got the nod -- and he would not disappoint.  Although he went goalless against the Indonesians, he would have found the back of the net if not for a desperate intervention by Justin Hubner that ultimately resulted in an own-goal.  Nonetheless, the 27-year-old was not to be denied on Tuesday with two clinical headers to help the Samurai Blue to a victory that ensures they will at least retain their seven-point lead at the top of Group C with only four games now remaining - and their World Cup ticket looking an increasing certainty.  Something of a late bloomer, Ogawa only earned his move to Europe last July when he joined Ueda in the Eredivisie by signing for NEC Nijmegen -- initially on loan before the transfer was made permament this summer.  The fact that he even made it to Europe was remarkable considering had not been playing for any of the J1 League's leading lights and, prior to 2023, had plied his trade in the second tier for four seasons.  NEC saw something in him and have been rewarded for their foresight, with Ogawa bagging 15 goals in 36 appearances last term, while he already has five in 11 league outings this season.   While he has a remarkable record of nine goals in as many appearances for Japan, Kōki Ogawa has spent much of his international career as a reserve option but showed in the past week he is a viable alternative to first-choice Ayase Ueda. Lintao Zhang/Getty Images On the international stage, his record is even more prolific.  Despite spending most of his time in the Japan fold as a back-up option, Ogawa's double against China restored his goal-a-game streak with nine from as many caps.  While his earlier goals came against less-illustrious opposition, the past four have all come against quality opposition in the third round of Asian qualifiers in the form of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and China.  Ogawa's ability to operate as a lone striker was always going to fit nicely in his national team setup, with Japan historically favouring a strong focal point in attack.  They have usually been more mobile types, even if current prototype Ueda and his predecessor Yuya Osako were also handy in the air.  Although his aerial prowess does make him seem like a behemoth, Ogawa actually stands at 1.86 metres as is hardly a lumbering sort.  The past two games have allowed him to show that he is also capable of doing a role as a link man, even if his best moments did still come as a target man.  His first goal against China was a thumping header off a corner from quite some distance out, before he showed good awareness to peel away from his marker and make space to nod home his second.  With the Asian qualifiers only resuming in March, Ueda is likely to have returned by then and it will not be a surprise if he automatically retains his starting berth.  Still, Ogawa could not have done more, especially over the past week, to show he can be a legitimate alternative as the spearhead to the Samurai Blue attack."
17,中國前鋒稱日本7比0「全靠陰招」　今晚再戰絕對不一樣,中國國家足球隊在9月5日世界盃亞洲區資格賽中，客場0比7遭日本血洗，近期中國擺脫低潮，分別擊敗了印尼以及巴林迎來2連勝，然而他們將在今（19日）晚間再度交手日本，對此中國前鋒張玉寧受訪時表示，今天絕不會再失7球，並說日本上一戰7比0全靠「耍陰招」。   戰績截至今天為止，日本隊在預選賽中11場比賽贏了10場（1平），只有澳洲在10月15日與日本1比1握手言和，在此期間日本總共攻進43球，而失球數僅僅1球。中國方面目前4勝5敗2平，對陣印尼與巴林二連勝期間皆有進球的前鋒張玉寧，接受中央電視台訪問時卻再次描述0比7慘敗日本的細節。   「賽前我們沒有做熱身，球隊巴士坐了兩個半小時，原本一個小時就能到，結果繞遠路，我們到場地綁完腳，做了15分鐘熱身就上場比賽，大家沒有完全準備好。」曾在荷甲維特斯效力的張玉寧說道。  張玉寧接著指控，當日球隊巴士特意「被繞遠路」，比原定時間多花了1.5小時才到日本琦玉體育場，導致球員熱身不足，而且太早失第一球，才導致慘敗，「丟球過早對陣型也有很大打擊，大家都知道，這種比賽我們能抗得越久，就真的能守得越久。」   「現在回到主場，客觀因素可以撇開不談，就內心來說，再跟日本踢多少場比賽，他們都不會再進我們7個球了，這是我的想法，我們可以比上一場做得更好。」張玉寧自信說道。  張玉寧的「日本陰謀論」自然也受到日媒轉載，日媒表示這場對日本，中國「即使拿1分也是奇蹟」，日本網友也在留言中酸道，「中國隊以進攻為主，可能要繼續大比數落敗」、「為什麼會覺得不會輸0比7呢？因為贏了巴林？還是贏了印尼？誤解很嚴重」、「想送回積分3分給中國，讓分組出線形勢變得更微妙」。
